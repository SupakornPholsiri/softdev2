correct: \\n\\n # aligned with opening delimiter. \\n foo   =   long_function_name ( var_one ,   var_two , \\n                          var_three ,   var_four ) \\n\\n # add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest. \\n def   long_function_name ( \\n         var_one ,   var_two ,   var_three , \\n         var_four ): \\n     print ( var_one ) \\n\\n # hanging indents should add a level. \\n foo   =   long_function_name ( \\n     var_one ,   var_two , \\n     var_three ,   var_four ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n\\n # arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment. \\n foo   =   long_function_name ( var_one ,   var_two , \\n     var_three ,   var_four ) \\n\\n # further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable. \\n def   long_function_name ( \\n     var_one ,   var_two ,   var_three , \\n     var_four ): \\n     print ( var_one ) \\n \\n \\n the 4-space rule is optional for continuation lines. \\n optional: \\n # hanging indents *may* be indented to other than 4 spaces. \\n foo   =   long_function_name ( \\n   var_one ,   var_two , \\n   var_three ,   var_four ) \\n \\n \\n when the conditional part of an  if -statement is long enough to require\\nthat it be written across multiple lines, it’s worth noting that the\\ncombination of a two character keyword (i.e.  if ), plus a single space,\\nplus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the\\nsubsequent lines of the multiline conditional.  this can produce a visual\\nconflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the  if -statement,\\nwhich would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces.  this pep takes no\\nexplicit position on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such\\nconditional lines from the nested suite inside the  if -statement.\\nacceptable options in this situation include, but are not limited to: \\n # no extra indentation. \\n if   ( this_is_one_thing   and \\n     that_is_another_thing ): \\n     do_something () \\n\\n # add a comment, which will provide some distinction in editors \\n # supporting syntax highlighting. \\n if   ( this_is_one_thing   and \\n     that_is_another_thing ): \\n     # since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate. \\n     do_something () \\n\\n # add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line. \\n if   ( this_is_one_thing \\n         and   that_is_another_thing ): \\n     do_something () \\n \\n \\n (also see the discussion of whether to break before or after binary\\noperators below.) \\n the closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline constructs may\\neither line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last\\nline of list, as in: \\n my_list   =   [ \\n     1 ,   2 ,   3 , \\n     4 ,   5 ,   6 , \\n     ] \\n result   =   some_function_that_takes_arguments ( \\n     \\'a\\' ,   \\'b\\' ,   \\'c\\' , \\n     \\'d\\' ,   \\'e\\' ,   \\'f\\' , \\n     ) \\n \\n \\n or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that\\nstarts the multiline construct, as in: \\n my_list   =   [ \\n     1 ,   2 ,   3 , \\n     4 ,   5 ,   6 , \\n ] \\n result   =   some_function_that_takes_arguments ( \\n     \\'a\\' ,   \\'b\\' ,   \\'c\\' , \\n     \\'d\\' ,   \\'e\\' ,   \\'f\\' , \\n ) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n tabs or spaces? \\n spaces are the preferred indentation method. \\n tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is\\nalready indented with tabs. \\n python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation. \\n \\n \\n maximum line length \\n limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. \\n for flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions\\n(docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72\\ncharacters. \\n limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have\\nseveral files open side by side, and works well when using code\\nreview tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns. \\n the default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the\\ncode, making it more difficult to understand. the limits are chosen to\\navoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even\\nif the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping\\nlines. some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all. \\n some teams strongly prefer a longer line length.  for code maintained\\nexclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this\\nissue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters,\\nprovided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72\\ncharacters. \\n the python standard library is conservative and requires limiting\\nlines to 79 characters (and docstrings/comments to 72). \\n the preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using python’s implied\\nline continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces.  long lines\\ncan be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in\\nparentheses. these should be used in preference to using a backslash\\nfor line continuation. \\n backslashes may still be appropriate at times.  for example, long,\\nmultiple  with -statements could not use implicit continuation\\nbefore python 3.10, so backslashes were acceptable for that case: \\n with   open ( \\'/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read\\' )   as   file_1 ,  \\\\\\n      open ( \\'/path/to/some/file/being/written\\' ,   \\'w\\' )   as   file_2 : \\n     file_2 . write ( file_1 . read ()) \\n \\n \\n (see the previous discussion on  multiline if-statements  for further\\nthoughts on the indentation of such multiline  with -statements.) \\n another such case is with  assert  statements. \\n make sure to indent the continued line appropriately. \\n \\n \\n should a line break before or after a binary operator? \\n for decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators.\\nbut this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get\\nscattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is\\nmoved away from its operand and onto the previous line.  here, the eye\\nhas to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are\\nsubtracted: \\n # wrong: \\n # operators sit far away from their operands \\n income   =   ( gross_wages   + \\n           taxable_interest   + \\n           ( dividends   -   qualified_dividends )   - \\n           ira_deduction   - \\n           student_loan_interest ) \\n \\n \\n to solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers\\nfollow the opposite convention.  donald knuth explains the traditional\\nrule in his  computers and typesetting  series: “although formulas\\nwithin a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations,\\ndisplayed formulas always break before binary operations”  [3] . \\n following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more\\nreadable code: \\n # correct: \\n # easy to match operators with operands \\n income   =   ( gross_wages \\n           +   taxable_interest \\n           +   ( dividends   -   qualified_dividends ) \\n           -   ira_deduction \\n           -   student_loan_interest ) \\n \\n \\n in python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary\\noperator, as long as the convention is consistent locally.  for new\\ncode knuth’s style is suggested. \\n \\n \\n blank lines \\n surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank\\nlines. \\n method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank\\nline. \\n extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of\\nrelated functions.  blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of\\nrelated one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations). \\n use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections. \\n python accepts the control-l (i.e. ^l) form feed character as\\nwhitespace; many tools treat these characters as page separators, so\\nyou may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file.\\nnote, some editors and web-based code viewers may not recognize\\ncontrol-l as a form feed and will show another glyph in its place. \\n \\n \\n source file encoding \\n code in the core python distribution should always use utf-8, and should not\\nhave an encoding declaration. \\n in the standard library, non-utf-8 encodings should be used only for\\ntest purposes. use non-ascii characters sparingly, preferably only to\\ndenote places and human names. if using non-ascii characters as data,\\navoid noisy unicode characters like z̯̯͡a̧͎̺l̡͓̫g̹̲o̡̼̘ and byte order\\nmarks. \\n all identifiers in the python standard library must use ascii-only\\nidentifiers, and should use english words wherever feasible (in many\\ncases, abbreviations and technical terms are used which aren’t\\nenglish). \\n open source projects with a global audience are encouraged to adopt a\\nsimilar policy. \\n \\n \\n imports \\n \\n imports should usually be on separate lines: # correct: \\n import   os \\n import   sys \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n import   sys ,   os \\n \\n \\n it’s okay to say this though: \\n # correct: \\n from   subprocess   import   popen ,   pipe \\n \\n \\n \\n imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module\\ncomments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants. imports should be grouped in the following order: \\n \\n standard library imports. \\n related third party imports. \\n local application/library specific imports. \\n \\n you should put a blank line between each group of imports. \\n \\n absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable\\nand tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error\\nmessages) if the import system is incorrectly configured (such as\\nwhen a directory inside a package ends up on  sys.path ): import   mypkg.sibling \\n from   mypkg   import   sibling \\n from   mypkg.sibling   import   example \\n \\n \\n however, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to\\nabsolute imports, especially when dealing with complex package layouts\\nwhere using absolute imports would be unnecessarily verbose: \\n from   .   import   sibling \\n from   .sibling   import   example \\n \\n \\n standard library code should avoid complex package layouts and always\\nuse absolute imports. \\n \\n when importing a class from a class-containing module, it’s usually\\nokay to spell this: from   myclass   import   myclass \\n from   foo.bar.yourclass   import   yourclass \\n \\n \\n if this spelling causes local name clashes, then spell them explicitly: \\n import   myclass \\n import   foo.bar.yourclass \\n \\n \\n and use “myclass.myclass” and “foo.bar.yourclass.yourclass”. \\n \\n wildcard imports ( from   <module>   import   * ) should be avoided, as\\nthey make it unclear which names are present in the namespace,\\nconfusing both readers and many automated tools. there is one\\ndefensible use case for a wildcard import, which is to republish an\\ninternal interface as part of a public api (for example, overwriting\\na pure python implementation of an interface with the definitions\\nfrom an optional accelerator module and exactly which definitions\\nwill be overwritten isn’t known in advance). when republishing names this way, the guidelines below regarding\\npublic and internal interfaces still apply. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n module level dunder names \\n module level “dunders” (i.e. names with two leading and two trailing\\nunderscores) such as  __all__ ,  __author__ ,  __version__ ,\\netc. should be placed after the module docstring but before any import\\nstatements  except   from   __future__  imports.  python mandates that\\nfuture-imports must appear in the module before any other code except\\ndocstrings: \\n \"\"\"this is the example module. \\n\\n this module does stuff. \\n \"\"\" \\n\\n from   __future__   import   barry_as_flufl \\n\\n __all__   =   [ \\'a\\' ,   \\'b\\' ,   \\'c\\' ] \\n __version__   =   \\'0.1\\' \\n __author__   =   \\'cardinal biggles\\' \\n\\n import   os \\n import   sys \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n string quotes \\n in python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the\\nsame.  this pep does not make a recommendation for this.  pick a rule\\nand stick to it.  when a string contains single or double quote\\ncharacters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the\\nstring. it improves readability. \\n for triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be\\nconsistent with the docstring convention in  pep 257 . \\n \\n \\n whitespace in expressions and statements \\n \\n pet peeves \\n avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations: \\n \\n immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces: # correct: \\n spam ( ham [ 1 ],   { eggs :   2 }) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n spam (   ham [   1   ],   {   eggs :   2   }   ) \\n \\n \\n \\n between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis: # correct: \\n foo   =   ( 0 ,) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n bar   =   ( 0 ,   ) \\n \\n \\n \\n immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon: # correct: \\n if   x   ==   4 :   print ( x ,   y );   x ,   y   =   y ,   x \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   x   ==   4   :   print ( x   ,   y )   ;   x   ,   y   =   y   ,   x \\n \\n \\n \\n however, in a slice the colon acts like a binary operator, and\\nshould have equal amounts on either side (treating it as the\\noperator with the lowest priority).  in an extended slice, both\\ncolons must have the same amount of spacing applied.  exception:\\nwhen a slice parameter is omitted, the space is omitted: # correct: \\n ham [ 1 : 9 ],   ham [ 1 : 9 : 3 ],   ham [: 9 : 3 ],   ham [ 1 :: 3 ],   ham [ 1 : 9 :] \\n ham [ lower : upper ],   ham [ lower : upper :],   ham [ lower :: step ] \\n ham [ lower + offset   :   upper + offset ] \\n ham [:   upper_fn ( x )   :   step_fn ( x )],   ham [::   step_fn ( x )] \\n ham [ lower   +   offset   :   upper   +   offset ] \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n ham [ lower   +   offset : upper   +   offset ] \\n ham [ 1 :   9 ],   ham [ 1   : 9 ],   ham [ 1 : 9   : 3 ] \\n ham [ lower   :   :   upper ] \\n ham [   :   upper ] \\n \\n \\n \\n immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument\\nlist of a function call: # correct: \\n spam ( 1 ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n spam   ( 1 ) \\n \\n \\n \\n immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or\\nslicing: # correct: \\n dct [ \\'key\\' ]   =   lst [ index ] \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n dct   [ \\'key\\' ]   =   lst   [ index ] \\n \\n \\n \\n more than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to\\nalign it with another: # correct: \\n x   =   1 \\n y   =   2 \\n long_variable   =   3 \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n x               =   1 \\n y               =   2 \\n long_variable   =   3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n other recommendations \\n \\n avoid trailing whitespace anywhere.  because it’s usually invisible,\\nit can be confusing: e.g. a backslash followed by a space and a\\nnewline does not count as a line continuation marker.  some editors\\ndon’t preserve it and many projects (like cpython itself) have\\npre-commit hooks that reject it. \\n always surround these binary operators with a single space on either\\nside: assignment ( = ), augmented assignment ( += ,  -= \\netc.), comparisons ( == ,  < ,  > ,  != ,  <> ,  <= ,\\n >= ,  in ,  not   in ,  is ,  is   not ), booleans ( and ,\\n or ,  not ). \\n if operators with different priorities are used, consider adding\\nwhitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). use\\nyour own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and\\nalways have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary\\noperator: #

\\n comments should be complete sentences.  the first word should be\\ncapitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case\\nletter (never alter the case of identifiers!). \\n block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of\\ncomplete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period. \\n you should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period in multi-\\nsentence comments, except after the final sentence. \\n ensure that your comments are clear and easily understandable to other\\nspeakers of the language you are writing in. \\n python coders from non-english speaking countries: please write your\\ncomments in english, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never\\nbe read by people who don’t speak your language. \\n \\n block comments \\n block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows\\nthem, and are indented to the same level as that code.  each line of a\\nblock comment starts with a  #  and a single space (unless it is\\nindented text inside the comment). \\n paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a\\nsingle  # . \\n \\n \\n inline comments \\n use inline comments sparingly. \\n an inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.\\ninline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the\\nstatement.  they should start with a # and a single space. \\n inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state\\nthe obvious.  don’t do this: \\n x   =   x   +   1                   # increment x \\n \\n \\n but sometimes, this is useful: \\n x   =   x   +   1                   # compensate for border \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n documentation strings \\n conventions for writing good documentation strings\\n(a.k.a. “docstrings”) are immortalized in  pep 257 . \\n \\n write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and\\nmethods.  docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but\\nyou should have a comment that describes what the method does.  this\\ncomment should appear after the  def  line. \\n pep 257  describes good docstring conventions.  note that most\\nimportantly, the  \"\"\"  that ends a multiline docstring should be\\non a line by itself: \"\"\"return a foobang \\n\\n optional plotz says to frobnicate the bizbaz first. \\n \"\"\" \\n \\n \\n \\n for one liner docstrings, please keep the closing  \"\"\"  on\\nthe same line: \"\"\"return an ex-parrot.\"\"\" \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n naming conventions \\n the naming conventions of python’s library are a bit of a mess, so\\nwe’ll never get this completely consistent – nevertheless, here are\\nthe currently recommended naming standards.  new modules and packages\\n(including third party frameworks) should be written to these\\nstandards, but where an existing library has a different style,\\ninternal consistency is preferred. \\n \\n overriding principle \\n names that are visible to the user as public parts of the api should\\nfollow conventions that reflect usage rather than implementation. \\n \\n \\n descriptive: naming styles \\n there are a lot of different naming styles.  it helps to be able to\\nrecognize what naming style is being used, independently from what\\nthey are used for. \\n the following naming styles are commonly distinguished: \\n \\n b  (single lowercase letter) \\n b  (single uppercase letter) \\n lowercase \\n lower_case_with_underscores \\n uppercase \\n upper_case_with_underscores \\n capitalizedwords  (or capwords, or camelcase – so named because\\nof the bumpy look of its letters  [4] ).  this is also sometimes known\\nas studlycaps. note: when using acronyms in capwords, capitalize all the\\nletters of the acronym.  thus httpservererror is better than\\nhttpservererror. \\n \\n mixedcase  (differs from capitalizedwords by initial lowercase\\ncharacter!) \\n capitalized_words_with_underscores  (ugly!) \\n \\n there’s also the style of using a short unique prefix to group related\\nnames together.  this is not used much in python, but it is mentioned\\nfor completeness.  for example, the  os.stat()  function returns a\\ntuple whose items traditionally have names like  st_mode ,\\n st_size ,  st_mtime  and so on.  (this is done to emphasize the\\ncorrespondence with the fields of the posix system call struct, which\\nhelps programmers familiar with that.) \\n the x11 library uses a leading x for all its public functions.  in\\npython, this style is generally deemed unnecessary because attribute\\nand method names are prefixed with an object, and function names are\\nprefixed with a module name. \\n in addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing\\nunderscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any\\ncase convention): \\n \\n _single_leading_underscore : weak “internal use” indicator.\\ne.g.  from   m   import   *  does not import objects whose names start\\nwith an underscore. \\n single_trailing_underscore_ : used by convention to avoid\\nconflicts with python keyword, e.g. tkinter . toplevel ( master ,   class_ = \\'classname\\' ) \\n \\n \\n \\n __double_leading_underscore : when naming a class attribute,\\ninvokes name mangling (inside class foobar,  __boo  becomes\\n _foobar__boo ; see below). \\n __double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__ : “magic” objects or\\nattributes that live in user-controlled namespaces.\\ne.g.  __init__ ,  __import__  or  __file__ .  never invent\\nsuch names; only use them as documented. \\n \\n \\n \\n prescriptive: naming conventions \\n \\n names to avoid \\n never use the characters ‘l’ (lowercase letter el), ‘o’ (uppercase\\nletter oh), or ‘i’ (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable\\nnames. \\n in some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the\\nnumerals one and zero.  when tempted to use ‘l’, use ‘l’ instead. \\n \\n \\n ascii compatibility \\n identifiers used in the standard library must be ascii compatible\\nas described in the\\n policy section \\nof  pep 3131 . \\n \\n \\n package and module names \\n modules should have short, all-lowercase names.  underscores can be\\nused in the module name if it improves readability.  python packages\\nshould also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of\\nunderscores is discouraged. \\n when an extension module written in c or c++ has an accompanying\\npython module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented)\\ninterface, the c/c++ module has a leading underscore\\n(e.g.  _socket ). \\n \\n \\n class names \\n class names should normally use the capwords convention. \\n the naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where\\nthe interface is documented and used primarily as a callable. \\n note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin\\nnames are single words (or two words run together), with the capwords\\nconvention used only for exception names and builtin constants. \\n \\n \\n type variable names \\n names of type variables introduced in  pep 484  should normally use capwords\\npreferring short names:  t ,  anystr ,  num . it is recommended to add\\nsuffixes  _co  or  _contra  to the variables used to declare covariant\\nor contravariant behavior correspondingly: \\n from   typing   import   typevar \\n\\n vt_co   =   typevar ( \\'vt_co\\' ,   covariant = true ) \\n kt_contra   =   typevar ( \\'kt_contra\\' ,   contravariant = true ) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n exception names \\n because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention\\napplies here.  however, you should use the suffix “error” on your\\nexception names (if the exception actually is an error). \\n \\n \\n global variable names \\n (let’s hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module\\nonly.)  the conventions are about the same as those for functions. \\n modules that are designed for use via  from   m   import   *  should use\\nthe  __all__  mechanism to prevent exporting globals, or use the\\nolder convention of prefixing such globals with an underscore (which\\nyou might want to do to indicate these globals are “module\\nnon-public”). \\n \\n \\n function and variable names \\n function names should be lowercase, with words separated by\\nunderscores as necessary to improve readability. \\n variable names follow the same convention as function names. \\n mixedcase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the\\nprevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards\\ncompatibility. \\n \\n \\n function and method arguments \\n always use  self  for the first argument to instance methods. \\n always use  cls  for the first argument to class methods. \\n if a function argument’s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is\\ngenerally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than\\nuse an abbreviation or spelling corruption.  thus  class_  is better\\nthan  clss .  (perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a\\nsynonym.) \\n \\n \\n method names and instance variables \\n use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by\\nunderscores as necessary to improve readability. \\n use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance\\nvariables. \\n to avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to\\ninvoke python’s name mangling rules. \\n python mangles these names with the class name: if class foo has an\\nattribute named  __a , it cannot be accessed by  foo.__a .  (an\\ninsistent user could still gain access by calling  foo._foo__a .)\\ngenerally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid\\nname conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed. \\n note: there is some controversy about the use of __names (see below). \\n \\n \\n constants \\n constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all\\ncapital letters with underscores separating words.  examples include\\n max_overflow  and  total . \\n \\n \\n designing for inheritance \\n always decide whether a class’s methods and instance variables\\n(collectively: “attributes”) should be public or non-public.  if in\\ndoubt, choose non-public; it’s easier to make it public later than to\\nmake a public attribute non-public. \\n public attributes are those that you expect unrelated clients of your\\nclass to use, with your commitment to avoid backwards incompatible\\nchanges.  non-public attributes are those that are not intended to be\\nused by third parties; you make no guarantees that non-public\\nattributes won’t change or even be removed. \\n we don’t use the term “private” here, since no attribute is really\\nprivate in python (without a generally unnecessary amount of work). \\n another category of attributes are those that are part of the\\n“subclass api” (often called “protected” in other languages).  some\\nclasses are designed to be inherited from, either to extend or modify\\naspects of the class’s behavior.  when designing such a class, take\\ncare to make explicit decisions about which attributes are public,\\nwhich are part of the subclass api, and which are truly only to be\\nused by your base class. \\n with this in mind, here are the pythonic guidelines: \\n \\n public attributes should have no leading underscores. \\n if your public attribute name collides with a reserved keyword,\\nappend a single trailing underscore to your attribute name.  this is\\npreferable to an abbreviation or corrupted spelling.  (however,\\nnotwithstanding this rule, ‘cls’ is the preferred spelling for any\\nvariable or argument which is known to be a class, especially the\\nfirst argument to a class method.) note 1: see the argument name recommendation above for class methods. \\n \\n for simple public data attributes, it is best to expose just the\\nattribute name, without complicated accessor/mutator methods.  keep\\nin mind that python provides an easy path to future enhancement,\\nshould you find that a simple data attribute needs to grow\\nfunctional behavior.  in that case, use properties to hide\\nfunctional implementation behind simple data attribute access\\nsyntax. note 1: try to keep the functional behavior side-effect free,\\nalthough side-effects such as caching are generally fine. \\n note 2: avoid using properties for computationally expensive\\noperations; the attribute notation makes the caller believe that\\naccess is (relatively) cheap. \\n \\n if your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes\\nthat you do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with\\ndouble leading underscores and no trailing underscores.  this\\ninvokes python’s name mangling algorithm, where the name of the\\nclass is mangled into the attribute name.  this helps avoid\\nattribute name collisions should subclasses inadvertently contain\\nattributes with the same name. note 1: note that only the simple class name is used in the mangled\\nname, so if a subclass chooses both the same class name and attribute\\nname, you can still get name collisions. \\n note 2: name mangling can make certain uses, such as debugging and\\n __getattr__() , less convenient.  however the name mangling\\nalgorithm is well documented and easy to perform manually. \\n note 3: not everyone likes name mangling.  try to balance the\\nneed to avoid accidental name clashes with potential use by\\nadvanced callers. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n public and internal interfaces \\n any backwards compatibility guarantees apply only to public interfaces.\\naccordingly, it is important that users be able to clearly distinguish\\nbetween public and internal interfaces. \\n documented interfaces are considered public, unless the documentation\\nexplicitly declares them to be provisional or internal interfaces exempt\\nfrom the usual backwards compatibility guarantees. all undocumented\\ninterfaces should be assumed to be internal. \\n to better support introspection, modules should explicitly declare the\\nnames in their public api using the  __all__  attribute. setting\\n __all__  to an empty list indicates that the module has no public api. \\n even with  __all__  set appropriately, internal interfaces (packages,\\nmodules, classes, functions, attributes or other names) should still be\\nprefixed with a single leading underscore. \\n an interface is also considered internal if any containing namespace\\n(package, module or class) is considered internal. \\n imported names should always be considered an implementation detail.\\nother modules must not rely on indirect access to such imported names\\nunless they are an explicitly documented part of the containing module’s\\napi, such as  os.path  or a package’s  __init__  module that exposes\\nfunctionality from submodules. \\n \\n \\n \\n programming recommendations \\n \\n code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other\\nimplementations of python (pypy, jython, ironpython, cython, psyco,\\nand such). for example, do not rely on cpython’s efficient implementation of\\nin-place string concatenation for statements in the form  a   +=   b \\nor  a   =   a   +   b .  this optimization is fragile even in cpython (it\\nonly works for some types) and isn’t present at all in implementations\\nthat don’t use refcounting.  in performance sensitive parts of the\\nlibrary, the  \\'\\'.join()  form should be used instead.  this will\\nensure that concatenation occurs in linear time across various\\nimplementations. \\n \\n comparisons to singletons like none should always be done with\\n is  or  is   not , never the equality operators. also, beware of writing  if   x  when you really mean  if   x   is   not \\n none  – e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that\\ndefaults to none was set to some other value.  the other value might\\nhave a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean\\ncontext! \\n \\n use  is   not  operator rather than  not   ...   is .  while both\\nexpressions are functionally identical, the former is more readable\\nand preferred: # correct: \\n if   foo   is   not   none : \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   not   foo   is   none : \\n \\n \\n \\n when implementing ordering operations with rich comparisons, it is\\nbest to implement all six operations ( __eq__ ,  __ne__ ,\\n __lt__ ,  __le__ ,  __gt__ ,  __ge__ ) rather than relying\\non other code to only exercise a particular comparison. to minimize the effort involved, the  functools.total_ordering() \\ndecorator provides a tool to generate missing comparison methods. \\n pep 207  indicates that reflexivity rules  are  assumed by python.\\nthus, the interpreter may swap  y   >   x  with  x   <   y ,  y   >=   x \\nwith  x   <=   y , and may swap the arguments of  x   ==   y  and  x   != \\n y .  the  sort()  and  min()  operations are guaranteed to use\\nthe  <  operator and the  max()  function uses the  > \\noperator.  however, it is best to implement all six operations so\\nthat confusion doesn’t arise in other contexts. \\n \\n always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds\\na lambda expression directly to an identifier: # correct: \\n def   f ( x ):   return   2 * x \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n f   =   lambda   x :   2 * x \\n \\n \\n the first form means that the name of the resulting function object is\\nspecifically ‘f’ instead of the generic ‘<lambda>’. this is more\\nuseful for tracebacks and string representations in general. the use\\nof the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda\\nexpression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can\\nbe embedded inside a larger expression) \\n \\n derive exceptions from  exception  rather than  baseexception .\\ndirect inheritance from  baseexception  is reserved for exceptions\\nwhere catching them is almost always the wrong thing to do. design exception hierarchies based on the distinctions that code\\n catching  the exceptions is likely to need, rather than the locations\\nwhere the exceptions are raised. aim to answer the question\\n“what went wrong?” programmatically, rather than only stating that\\n“a problem occurred” (see  pep 3151  for an example of this lesson being\\nlearned for the builtin exception hierarchy) \\n class naming conventions apply here, although you should add the\\nsuffix “error” to your exception classes if the exception is an\\nerror.  non-error exceptions that are used for non-local flow control\\nor other forms of signaling need no special suffix. \\n \\n use exception chaining appropriately.  raise   x   from   y \\nshould be used to indicate explicit replacement without losing the\\noriginal traceback. when deliberately replacing an inner exception (using  raise   x   from \\n none ), ensure that relevant details are transferred to the new\\nexception (such as preserving the attribute name when converting\\nkeyerror to attributeerror, or embedding the text of the original\\nexception in the new exception message). \\n \\n when catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever\\npossible instead of using a bare  except:  clause: try : \\n     import   platform_specific_module \\n except   importerror : \\n     platform_specific_module   =   none \\n \\n \\n a bare  except:  clause will catch systemexit and\\nkeyboardinterrupt exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a\\nprogram with control-c, and can disguise other problems.  if you\\nwant to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use\\n except   exception:  (bare except is equivalent to  except \\n baseexception: ). \\n a good rule of thumb is to limit use of bare ‘except’ clauses to two\\ncases: \\n \\n if the exception handler will be printing out or logging the\\ntraceback; at least the user will be aware that an error has\\noccurred. \\n if the code needs to do some cleanup work, but then lets the\\nexception propagate upwards with  raise .   try...finally \\ncan be a better way to handle this case. \\n \\n \\n when catching operating system errors, prefer the explicit exception\\nhierarchy introduced in python 3.3 over introspection of  errno \\nvalues. \\n additionally, for all try/except clauses, limit the  try  clause\\nto the absolute minimum amount of code necessary.  again, this\\navoids masking bugs: # correct: \\n try : \\n     value   =   collection [ key ] \\n except   keyerror : \\n     return   key_not_found ( key ) \\n else : \\n     return   handle_value ( value ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n try : \\n     # too broad! \\n     return   handle_value ( collection [ key ]) \\n except   keyerror : \\n     # will also catch keyerror raised by handle_value() \\n     return   key_not_found ( key ) \\n \\n \\n \\n when a resource is local to a particular section of code, use a\\n with  statement to ensure it is cleaned up promptly and reliably\\nafter use. a try/finally statement is also acceptable. \\n context managers should be invoked through separate functions or methods\\nwhenever they do something other than acquire and release resources: # correct: \\n with   conn . begin_transaction (): \\n     do_stuff_in_transaction ( conn ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n with   conn : \\n     do_stuff_in_transaction ( conn ) \\n \\n \\n the latter example doesn’t provide any information to indicate that\\nthe  __enter__  and  __exit__  methods are doing something other\\nthan closing the connection after a transaction.  being explicit is\\nimportant in this case. \\n \\n be consistent in return statements.  either all return statements in\\na function should return an expression, or none of them should.  if\\nany return statement returns an expression, any return statements\\nwhere no value is returned should explicitly state this as  return \\n none , and an explicit return statement should be present at the\\nend of the function (if reachable): # correct: \\n\\n def   foo ( x ): \\n     if   x   >=   0 : \\n         return   math . sqrt ( x ) \\n     else : \\n         return   none \\n\\n def   bar ( x ): \\n     if   x   <   0 : \\n         return   none \\n     return   math . sqrt ( x ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n\\n def   foo ( x ): \\n     if   x   >=   0 : \\n         return   math . sqrt ( x ) \\n\\n def   bar ( x ): \\n     if   x   <   0 : \\n         return \\n     return   math . sqrt ( x ) \\n \\n \\n \\n use  \\'\\'.startswith()  and  \\'\\'.endswith()  instead of string\\nslicing to check for prefixes or suffixes. startswith() and endswith() are cleaner and less error prone: \\n # correct: \\n if   foo . startswith ( \\'bar\\' ): \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   foo [: 3 ]   ==   \\'bar\\' : \\n \\n \\n \\n object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead of\\ncomparing types directly: # correct: \\n if   isinstance ( obj ,   int ): \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   type ( obj )   is   type ( 1 ): \\n \\n \\n \\n for sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty\\nsequences are false: # correct: \\n if   not   seq : \\n if   seq : \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   len ( seq ): \\n if   not   len ( seq ): \\n \\n \\n \\n don’t write string literals that rely on significant trailing\\nwhitespace.  such trailing whitespace is visually indistinguishable\\nand some editors (or more recently, reindent.py) will trim them. \\n don’t compare boolean values to true or false using  == : # correct: \\n if   greeting : \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   greeting   ==   true : \\n \\n \\n worse: \\n # wrong: \\n if   greeting   is   true : \\n \\n \\n \\n use of the flow control statements  return / break / continue \\nwithin the finally suite of a  try...finally , where the flow control\\nstatement would jump outside the finally suite, is discouraged.  this\\nis because such statements will implicitly cancel any active exception\\nthat is propagating through the finally suite: # wrong: \\n def   foo (): \\n     try : \\n         1   /   0 \\n     finally : \\n         return   42 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n function annotations \\n with the acceptance of  pep 484 , the style rules for function\\nannotations have changed. \\n \\n function annotations should use  pep 484  syntax (there are some\\nformatting recommendations for annotations in the previous section). \\n the experimentation with annotation styles that was recommended\\npreviously in this pep is no longer encouraged. \\n however, outside the stdlib, experiments within the rules of  pep 484 \\nare now encouraged.  for example, marking up a large third party\\nlibrary or application with  pep 484  style type annotations,\\nreviewing how easy it was to add those annotations, and observing\\nwhether their presence increases code understandability. \\n the python standard library should be conservative in adopting such\\nannotations, but their use is allowed for new code and for big\\nrefactorings. \\n for code that wants to make a different use of function annotations\\nit is recommended to put a comment of the form: # type: ignore \\n \\n \\n near the top of the file; this tells type checkers to ignore all\\nannotations.  (more fine-grained ways of disabling complaints from\\ntype checkers can be found in  pep 484 .) \\n \\n like linters, type checkers are optional, separate tools.  python\\ninterpreters by default should not issue any messages due to type\\nchecking and should not alter their behavior based on annotations. \\n users who don’t want to use type checkers are free to ignore them.\\nhowever, it is expected that users of third party library packages\\nmay want to run type checkers over those packages.  for this purpose\\n pep 484  recommends the use of stub files: .pyi files that are read\\nby the type checker in preference of the corresponding .py files.\\nstub files can be distributed with a library, or separately (with\\nthe library author’s permission) through the typeshed repo  [5] . \\n \\n \\n \\n variable annotations \\n pep 526  introduced variable annotations. the style recommendations for them are\\nsimilar to those on function annotations described above: \\n \\n annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables,\\nand local variables should have a single space after the colon. \\n there should be no space before the colon. \\n if an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have\\nexactly one space on both sides: # correct: \\n\\n code :   int \\n\\n class   point : \\n     coords :   tuple [ int ,   int ] \\n     label :   str   =   \\'<unknown>\\' \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n\\n code : int    # no space after colon \\n code   :   int    # space before colon \\n\\n class   test : \\n     result :   int = 0    # no spaces around equality sign \\n \\n \\n \\n although the  pep 526  is accepted for python 3.6, the variable annotation\\nsyntax is the preferred syntax for stub files on all versions of python\\n(see  pep 484  for details). \\n \\n footnotes \\n \\n \\n [ 1 ] \\n hanging indentation  is a type-setting style where all\\nthe lines in a paragraph are indented except the first line.  in\\nthe context of python, the term is used to describe a style where\\nthe opening parenthesis of a parenthesized statement is the last\\nnon-whitespace character of the line, with subsequent lines being\\nindented until the closing parenthesis. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n references \\n \\n \\n [ 2 ] \\n barry’s gnu mailman style guide\\n http://barry.warsaw.us/software/styleguide.txt \\n \\n [ 3 ] \\n donald knuth’s  the texbook , pages 195 and 196. \\n \\n [ 4 ] \\n http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/camelcase \\n \\n [ 5 ] \\n typeshed repo\\n https://github.com/python/typeshed \\n \\n \\n \\n copyright \\n this document has been placed in the public domain. \\n \\n \\n \\n source:  https://github.com/python/peps/blob/main/pep-0008.txt \\n last modified:  2022-05-11 17:45:05 gmt \\n \\n \\n contents \\n \\n introduction \\n a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds \\n code lay-out \\n indentation \\n tabs or spaces? \\n maximum line length \\n should a line break before or after a binary operator? \\n blank lines \\n source file encoding \\n imports \\n module level dunder names \\n \\n \\n string quotes \\n whitespace in expressions and statements \\n pet peeves \\n other recommendations \\n \\n \\n when to use trailing commas \\n comments \\n block comments \\n inline comments \\n documentation strings \\n \\n \\n naming conventions \\n overriding principle \\n descriptive: naming styles \\n prescriptive: naming conventions \\n names to avoid \\n ascii compatibility \\n package and module names \\n class names \\n type variable names \\n exception names \\n global variable names \\n function and variable names \\n function and method arguments \\n method names and instance variables \\n constants \\n designing for inheritance \\n \\n \\n public and internal interfaces \\n \\n \\n programming recommendations \\n function annotations \\n variable annotations \\n \\n \\n references \\n copyright \\n \\n \\n page source (github) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

lathiya   \\n \\n \\n the  urllib  is an inbuilt python module that handles the url efficiently. the urllib library\\xa0is used to fetch urls (uniform resource locators). it uses the  urlopen  function and can fetch urls using a variety of different protocols. \\n the urllib is a package that collects several modules for working with urls, such as: \\n \\n the  urllib.request  module is used for opening and reading. \\n the  urllib.parse  module is used for parsing urls. \\n the  urllib.error  module\\xa0is used for the exceptions raised. \\n the  urllib.robotparser  module\\xa0is used for parsing robot.txt files. \\n \\n python urllib.request module \\n the urllib.request module defines functions and classes which help in opening urls (mostly http) in a complex world — basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies, and more.  \\n \\n  \\n python urllib.request.urlopen() \\n the urllib.request.urlopen() is an inbuilt python method that opens the url url, either a string or a request object. the data must be an object specifying additional data to be sent to the server, or none if no such data is needed. \\n syntax \\n urllib.request.urlopen(url, data=none, [timeout, ]*, cafile=none, \\n                       capath=none, cadefault=false, context=none) \\n parameters \\n the urllib.request  module  uses http/1.1 and includes connection:close header in its http requests.  \\n the optional timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout setting will be used). this actually only works for http, https, and ftp connections. \\n if the context is specified, it must be an ssl.sslcontext instance describing the various ssl options. see httpsconnection for more details. \\n the optional cafile and capath parameters specify a set of trusted ca certificates for https requests. cafile should point to a single file containing a bundle of ca certificates, whereas capath should point to a directory of hashed certificate files. more information can be found in ssl.sslcontext.load_verify_locations(). \\n the cadefault parameter is ignored. \\n example \\n import urllib.request\\n\\nreq_url = urllib.request.urlopen(\"https://appdividend.com\")\\nprint(req_url.read())\\n \\n you can also use the  with statement  with the above code. \\n import urllib.request\\n\\nwith urllib.request.urlopen(\\'https://appdividend.com\\') as response:\\n    html = response.read()\\n    print(html)\\n \\n that is it for python urllib.request.urlopen()

@jamesmcmahon - it\\'s a trade-off between explicitness and type flexibility.  generally, \"being explicit\" means not doing \"magical\" things.  on the other hand, \"duck typing\" means working with more general interfaces, rather than explicitly checking for types.  so something like  if a == []  is forcing a particular type ( () == []  is  false ).  here, general consensus seems to be that duck typing wins out (in effect, saying that  __nonzero__  is the interface for testing emptiness  docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__nonzero__ ) \\n \\r\\n–\\xa0 andrew cooke \\n \\n may

the first element and seeing if it is null, assuming an array that is nul-terminated. otherwise, comparing its length to zero is utterly inefficient if the array is of a significant size. also, typically, you would not allocate memory for an empty array (pointer remains null), so it makes no sense to attempt to get its length. i am not saying that len(a) == 0 is not a good way of doing it, it just does not scream \\'c\\' to me when i see it. \\n \\r\\n–\\xa0 sleblanc \\n \\n apr 2, 2019 at 23:55 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 92 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n coming from a language that claims to be

violating idioms in a language with strong idioms like python is bad in general) is that it signals to the reader that you\\'re specifically checking the length for some reason (e.g., because you want  none  or  0  to raise an exception rather than passing). so, when you do it for no reason, that\\'s misleading—and it also means that when your code  does  need to make the distinction, the distinction is invisible because you\\'ve \"cried wolf\" all over the rest of the source. \\n \\r\\n–\\xa0 abarnert \\n \\n dec 3, 2014 at 2:05 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 32 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n i

\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n this is the first google hit for \"python test empty array\" and similar queries, and other people are generalizing the question beyond just lists, so here\\'s a caveat for a different type of sequence that a lot of people use. \\n other methods don\\'t work for numpy arrays \\n you need to be careful with numpy arrays, because other methods that work fine for  list s or other standard containers fail for numpy arrays.  i explain why below, but in short, the  preferred method  is to use  size . \\n the \"pythonic\" way doesn\\'t work: part 1 \\n the \"pythonic\" way fails with numpy arrays because numpy tries to cast the array to an array of  bool s, and  if x  tries to evaluate all of those  bool s at once for some kind of aggregate truth value.  but this doesn\\'t make any sense, so you get a  valueerror : \\n >>> x = numpy.array([0,1])\\n>>> if x: print(\"x\")\\nvalueerror: the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. use a.any() or a.all()\\n \\n the \"pythonic\" way doesn\\'t work: part 2 \\n but at least the case above tells you that it failed.  if you happen to have a numpy array with exactly one element, the  if  statement will \"work\", in the sense that you don\\'t get an error.  however, if that one element happens to be  0  (or  0.0 , or  false , ...), the  if  statement will incorrectly result in  false : \\n >>> x = numpy.array([0,])\\n>>> if x: print(\"x\")\\n... else: print(\"no x\")\\nno x\\n \\n but clearly  x  exists and is not empty!  this result is not what you wanted. \\n using  len  can give unexpected results \\n for example, \\n len( numpy.zeros((1,0)) )\\n \\n returns 1, even though the array has zero elements. \\n the numpythonic way \\n as explained in the  scipy faq , the correct method in all cases where you know you have a numpy array is to use  if x.size : \\n >>> x = numpy.array([0,1])\\n>>> if x.size: print(\"x\")\\nx\\n\\n>>> x = numpy.array([0,])\\n>>> if x.size: print(\"x\")\\n... else: print(\"no x\")\\nx\\n\\n>>> x = numpy.zeros((1,0))\\n>>> if x.size: print(\"x\")\\n... else: print(\"no x\")\\nno x\\n \\n if you\\'re not sure whether it might be a  list , a numpy array, or something else, you could combine this approach with  the answer @dubiousjim gives  to make sure the right test is used for each type.  not very \"pythonic\", but it turns out that numpy intentionally broke pythonicity in at least this sense. \\n if you need to do more than just check if the input is empty, and you\\'re using other numpy features like indexing or math operations, it\\'s probably more efficient (and certainly more common) to force the input  to be  a numpy array.  there are a few nice functions for doing this quickly —\\xa0most importantly  numpy.asarray .  this takes your input, does nothing if it\\'s already an array, or wraps your input into an array if it\\'s a list, tuple, etc., and optionally converts it to your chosen  dtype .  so it\\'s very quick whenever it can be, and it ensures that you just get to assume the input is a numpy array.  we usually even just use the same name, as the conversion to an array won\\'t make it back outside of the current  scope : \\n x = numpy.asarray(x, dtype=numpy.double)\\n \\n this will make the  x.size  check work in all cases i see on this page. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n share

\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n best way to check if a list is empty \\n for example, if passed the following: \\n a = []\\n \\n how do i check to see if a is empty? \\n \\n short answer: \\n place the list in a boolean context (for example, with an  if  or  while  statement). it will test  false  if it is empty, and  true  otherwise. for example: \\n if not a:                           # do this!\\n    print(\\'a is an empty list\\')\\n \\n pep 8 \\n pep 8 , the official python style guide for python code in python\\'s standard library, asserts: \\n \\n for sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are false. \\n yes: if not seq:\\n     if seq:\\n\\nno: if len(seq):\\n    if not len(seq):\\n \\n \\n we should expect that standard library code should be as performant and correct as possible. but why is that the case, and why do we need this guidance? \\n explanation \\n i frequently see code like this from experienced programmers new to python: \\n if len(a) == 0:                     # don\\'t do this!\\n    print(\\'a is an empty list\\')\\n \\n and users of lazy languages may be tempted to do this: \\n if a == []:                         # don\\'t do this!\\n    print(\\'a is an empty list\\')\\n \\n these are correct in their respective other languages. and this is even semantically correct in python.  \\n but we consider it un-pythonic because python supports these semantics directly in the list object\\'s interface via boolean coercion. \\n from the  docs  (and note specifically the inclusion of the empty list,  [] ): \\n \\n by default, an object is considered true unless its class defines\\n  either a  __bool__()  method that returns  false  or a  __len__()  method\\n  that returns zero, when called with the object. here are most of the built-in objects considered false: \\n \\n constants defined to be false:  none  and  false . \\n zero of any numeric type:  0 ,  0.0 ,  0j ,  decimal(0) ,  fraction(0, 1) \\n empty sequences and collections:  \\'\\' ,  () ,  [] ,  {} ,  set() ,  range(0) \\n \\n \\n and the datamodel documentation: \\n \\n object.__bool__(self) \\n called to implement truth value testing and the built-in operation  bool() ; should return  false  or  true . when this method is not defined,\\n   __len__()  is called, if it is defined, and the object is considered true if its result is nonzero. if a class defines neither  __len__() \\n  nor  __bool__() , all its instances are considered true. \\n \\n and  \\n \\n object.__len__(self) \\n called to implement the built-in function  len() . should return the length of the object, an integer >= 0. also, an object that doesn’t define a  __bool__()  method and whose  __len__()  method returns zero is considered to be false in a boolean context. \\n \\n so instead of this: \\n if len(a) == 0:                     # don\\'t do this!\\n    print(\\'a is an empty list\\')\\n \\n or this: \\n if a == []:                     # don\\'t do this!\\n    print(\\'a is an empty list\\')\\n \\n do this: \\n if not a:\\n    print(\\'a is an empty list\\')\\n \\n doing what\\'s pythonic usually pays off in performance: \\n does it pay off? (note that less time to perform an equivalent operation is better:) \\n >>> import timeit\\n>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: len([]) == 0, repeat=100))\\n0.13775854044661884\\n>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: [] == [], repeat=100))\\n0.0984637276455409\\n>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: not [], repeat=100))\\n0.07878462291455435\\n \\n for scale, here\\'s the cost of calling the function and constructing and returning an empty list, which you might subtract from the costs of the emptiness checks used above: \\n >>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: [], repeat=100))\\n0.07074015751817342\\n \\n we see that  either  checking for length with the builtin function  len  compared to  0   or  checking against an empty list is  much  less performant than using the builtin syntax of the language as documented. \\n why? \\n for the  len(a) == 0  check: \\n first python has to check the globals to see if  len  is shadowed.  \\n then it must call the function, load  0 , and do the equality comparison in python (instead of with c): \\n >>> import dis\\n>>> dis.dis(lambda: len([]) == 0)\\n  1           0 load_global              0 (len)\\n              2 build_list               0\\n              4 call_function            1\\n              6 load_const               1 (0)\\n              8 compare_op               2 (==)\\n             10 return_value\\n \\n and for the  [] == []  it has to build an unnecessary list and then, again, do the comparison operation in python\\'s virtual machine (as opposed to c) \\n >>> dis.dis(lambda: [] == [])\\n  1           0 build_list               0\\n              2 build_list               0\\n              4 compare_op               2 (==)\\n              6 return_value\\n \\n the \"pythonic\" way is a much simpler and faster check since the length of the list is cached in the object instance header: \\n >>> dis.dis(lambda: not [])\\n  1           0 build_list               0\\n              2 unary_not\\n              4 return_value\\n \\n evidence from the c source and documentation \\n \\n pyvarobject \\n this is an extension of  pyobject  that adds the  ob_size  field. this is only used for objects that have some notion of length. this type does not often appear in the python/c api. it corresponds to the fields defined by the expansion of the  pyobject_var_head  macro. \\n \\n from the c source in  include/listobject.h : \\n typedef struct {\\n    pyobject_var_head\\n    /* vector of pointers to list elements.  list[0] is ob_item[0], etc.

answer  is right:  if not a:  is the right way to do it.  harley holcombe\\'s answer  is right that this is in the pep 8 style guide. but what none of the answers explain is why it\\'s a good idea to follow the idiom—even if you personally find it\\'s not explicit enough or confusing to ruby users or whatever. \\n python code, and the python community, has very strong idioms. following those idioms makes your code easier to read for anyone experienced in python. and when you violate those idioms, that\\'s a strong signal. \\n it\\'s true that  if not a:  doesn\\'t distinguish empty lists from  none , or numeric 0, or empty tuples, or empty user-created collection types, or empty user-created not-quite-collection types, or single-element numpy array acting as scalars with falsey values, etc. and sometimes it\\'s important to be explicit about that. and in that case, you know  what  you want to be explicit about, so you can test for exactly that. for example,  if not a and a is not none:  means \"anything falsey except none\", while  if len(a) != 0:  means \"only empty sequences—and anything besides a sequence is an error here\", and so on. besides testing for exactly what you want to test, this also signals to the reader that this test is important. \\n but when you don\\'t have anything to be explicit about, anything other than  if not a:  is misleading the reader. you\\'re signaling something as important when it isn\\'t. (you may also be making the code less flexible, or slower, or whatever, but that\\'s all less important.) and if you  habitually  mislead the reader like this, then when you  do  need to make a distinction, it\\'s going to pass unnoticed because you\\'ve been \"crying wolf\" all over your code. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n share \\n \\n \\n improve this answer \\n \\n \\n \\r\\n

what if it isn’t empty? process it?  the point is, still, that you  probably  don’t need to check for an empty list, just iterate over it and  do whatever you were going to do  with the elements.  if there are no elements, you fall through.  if there are elements, you process them as you need to.  the point is not to use the example for an empty-check but rather to not check at all, just process the list. \\n \\r\\n–\\xa0 mrwonderful \\n \\n jun 27, 2019 at 4:07 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n good answer, but  !a  is a syntax error.  it should be  not a . \\n \\r\\n–\\xa0

because readers objected to the strategy or thought the answer wasn\\'t helpful as presented. i\\'ll pretend it was the latter, since---whatever counts as \"pythonic\"---this is the correct strategy. unless you\\'ve already ruled out, or are prepared to handle cases where  a  is, for example,  false , you need a test more restrictive than just  if not a: . you could use something like this: \\n if isinstance(a, numpy.ndarray) and not a.size:\\n    do_stuff\\nelif isinstance(a, collections.sized) and not a:\\n    do_stuff\\n \\n the first test is in response to @mike\\'s answer, above. the third line could also be replaced with: \\n elif isinstance(a, (list, tuple)) and not a:\\n \\n if you only want to accept instances of particular types (and their subtypes), or with: \\n elif isinstance(a, (list, tuple)) and not len(a):\\n \\n you can get away without the explicit type check, but only if the surrounding context already assures you that  a  is a value of the types you\\'re prepared to handle, or if you\\'re sure that types you\\'re not prepared to handle are going to raise errors (e.g., a  typeerror  if you call  len  on a value for which it\\'s undefined) that you\\'re prepared to handle. in general, the \"pythonic\" conventions seem to go this last way. squeeze it like a duck and let it raise a duckerror if it doesn\\'t know how to quack. you still have to  think  about what type assumptions you\\'re making, though, and whether the cases you\\'re not prepared to handle properly really are going to error out in the right places. the numpy arrays are a good example where just blindly relying on  len  or the boolean typecast may not do precisely what you\\'re expecting. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n share \\n \\n \\n improve this answer \\n \\n \\n \\r\\n

for any other types. when you need that kind of thing, you probably want an abc. in this case, it would probably be one of the stdlib abcs, like  collections.abc.sized  or  collections.abc.sequence , but it might be one you write yourself and  register(list)  on. if you actually do have code where it\\'s important to distinguish empty from other falsey, and also to distinguish lists and tuples from any other sequences, then this is correct—but i don\\'t believe you have such code. \\n \\r\\n–\\xa0 abarnert \\n \\n dec 3, 2014 at 2:09 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 14 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n the reason people don\\'t like this is because it\\'s entirely unnessesary in most cases. python is a duck-typed language, and this level of defensive coding actively hinders that. the idea behind python\\'s type system is that things should work as long as the object passed in functions in the way it needs to. by doing explicit type checks you are forcing the caller to use specific types, going against the very grain of the language. while occasionally such things are necessary (excluding strings from being treated as sequences), such cases are rare and almost always best as blacklists. \\n \\r\\n–\\xa0 gareth latty \\n \\n feb 16, 2015 at 20:54 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n if you really want to check that the value is exactly  []  and not something

[] == ()  for instance returns  false . but for example  frozenset()==set()  returns  true . so it\\'s worth at least giving some thought to whether some undesired type might be coerced to  []  (or

constructing an empty list to compare against.  also, as another pointed out, the equality operator may invoke implicit conversion of some types, which may be undesirable.  there is no reason to ever code \"a == []\" and that code would definitely be flagged as a defect in any code review i\\'ve participated in.  using the appropriate tool as provided by the language should not be considered

(it\\'s a  less pythonic  way): \\n def enquiry(list1):\\n    return len(list1) == 0\\n \\n \\n list1 = []\\n\\nif enquiry(list1):\\n    print(\"the list isn\\'t empty\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\"the list is empty\")\\n\\n# result: \"the list is empty\".\\n \\n the second way is a  more pythonic  one. this method is an implicit way of checking and much more preferable than the previous one. \\n

correct: \\n\\n # aligned with opening delimiter. \\n foo   =   long_function_name ( var_one ,   var_two , \\n                          var_three ,   var_four ) \\n\\n # add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest. \\n def   long_function_name ( \\n         var_one ,   var_two ,   var_three , \\n         var_four ): \\n     print ( var_one ) \\n\\n # hanging indents should add a level. \\n foo   =   long_function_name ( \\n     var_one ,   var_two , \\n     var_three ,   var_four ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n\\n # arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment. \\n foo   =   long_function_name ( var_one ,   var_two , \\n     var_three ,   var_four ) \\n\\n # further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable. \\n def   long_function_name ( \\n     var_one ,   var_two ,   var_three , \\n     var_four ): \\n     print ( var_one ) \\n \\n \\n the 4-space rule is optional for continuation lines. \\n optional: \\n # hanging indents *may* be indented to other than 4 spaces. \\n foo   =   long_function_name ( \\n   var_one ,   var_two , \\n   var_three ,   var_four ) \\n \\n \\n when the conditional part of an  if -statement is long enough to require\\nthat it be written across multiple lines, it’s worth noting that the\\ncombination of a two character keyword (i.e.  if ), plus a single space,\\nplus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the\\nsubsequent lines of the multiline conditional.  this can produce a visual\\nconflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the  if -statement,\\nwhich would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces.  this pep takes no\\nexplicit position on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such\\nconditional lines from the nested suite inside the  if -statement.\\nacceptable options in this situation include, but are not limited to: \\n # no extra indentation. \\n if   ( this_is_one_thing   and \\n     that_is_another_thing ): \\n     do_something () \\n\\n # add a comment, which will provide some distinction in editors \\n # supporting syntax highlighting. \\n if   ( this_is_one_thing   and \\n     that_is_another_thing ): \\n     # since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate. \\n     do_something () \\n\\n # add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line. \\n if   ( this_is_one_thing \\n         and   that_is_another_thing ): \\n     do_something () \\n \\n \\n (also see the discussion of whether to break before or after binary\\noperators below.) \\n the closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline constructs may\\neither line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last\\nline of list, as in: \\n my_list   =   [ \\n     1 ,   2 ,   3 , \\n     4 ,   5 ,   6 , \\n     ] \\n result   =   some_function_that_takes_arguments ( \\n     \\'a\\' ,   \\'b\\' ,   \\'c\\' , \\n     \\'d\\' ,   \\'e\\' ,   \\'f\\' , \\n     ) \\n \\n \\n or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that\\nstarts the multiline construct, as in: \\n my_list   =   [ \\n     1 ,   2 ,   3 , \\n     4 ,   5 ,   6 , \\n ] \\n result   =   some_function_that_takes_arguments ( \\n     \\'a\\' ,   \\'b\\' ,   \\'c\\' , \\n     \\'d\\' ,   \\'e\\' ,   \\'f\\' , \\n ) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n tabs or spaces? \\n spaces are the preferred indentation method. \\n tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is\\nalready indented with tabs. \\n python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation. \\n \\n \\n maximum line length \\n limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. \\n for flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions\\n(docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72\\ncharacters. \\n limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have\\nseveral files open side by side, and works well when using code\\nreview tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns. \\n the default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the\\ncode, making it more difficult to understand. the limits are chosen to\\navoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even\\nif the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping\\nlines. some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all. \\n some teams strongly prefer a longer line length.  for code maintained\\nexclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this\\nissue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters,\\nprovided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72\\ncharacters. \\n the python standard library is conservative and requires limiting\\nlines to 79 characters (and docstrings/comments to 72). \\n the preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using python’s implied\\nline continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces.  long lines\\ncan be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in\\nparentheses. these should be used in preference to using a backslash\\nfor line continuation. \\n backslashes may still be appropriate at times.  for example, long,\\nmultiple  with -statements could not use implicit continuation\\nbefore python 3.10, so backslashes were acceptable for that case: \\n with   open ( \\'/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read\\' )   as   file_1 ,  \\\\\\n      open ( \\'/path/to/some/file/being/written\\' ,   \\'w\\' )   as   file_2 : \\n     file_2 . write ( file_1 . read ()) \\n \\n \\n (see the previous discussion on  multiline if-statements  for further\\nthoughts on the indentation of such multiline  with -statements.) \\n another such case is with  assert  statements. \\n make sure to indent the continued line appropriately. \\n \\n \\n should a line break before or after a binary operator? \\n for decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators.\\nbut this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get\\nscattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is\\nmoved away from its operand and onto the previous line.  here, the eye\\nhas to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are\\nsubtracted: \\n # wrong: \\n # operators sit far away from their operands \\n income   =   ( gross_wages   + \\n           taxable_interest   + \\n           ( dividends   -   qualified_dividends )   - \\n           ira_deduction   - \\n           student_loan_interest ) \\n \\n \\n to solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers\\nfollow the opposite convention.  donald knuth explains the traditional\\nrule in his  computers and typesetting  series: “although formulas\\nwithin a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations,\\ndisplayed formulas always break before binary operations”  [3] . \\n following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more\\nreadable code: \\n # correct: \\n # easy to match operators with operands \\n income   =   ( gross_wages \\n           +   taxable_interest \\n           +   ( dividends   -   qualified_dividends ) \\n           -   ira_deduction \\n           -   student_loan_interest ) \\n \\n \\n in python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary\\noperator, as long as the convention is consistent locally.  for new\\ncode knuth’s style is suggested. \\n \\n \\n blank lines \\n surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank\\nlines. \\n method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank\\nline. \\n extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of\\nrelated functions.  blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of\\nrelated one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations). \\n use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections. \\n python accepts the control-l (i.e. ^l) form feed character as\\nwhitespace; many tools treat these characters as page separators, so\\nyou may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file.\\nnote, some editors and web-based code viewers may not recognize\\ncontrol-l as a form feed and will show another glyph in its place. \\n \\n \\n source file encoding \\n code in the core python distribution should always use utf-8, and should not\\nhave an encoding declaration. \\n in the standard library, non-utf-8 encodings should be used only for\\ntest purposes. use non-ascii characters sparingly, preferably only to\\ndenote places and human names. if using non-ascii characters as data,\\navoid noisy unicode characters like z̯̯͡a̧͎̺l̡͓̫g̹̲o̡̼̘ and byte order\\nmarks. \\n all identifiers in the python standard library must use ascii-only\\nidentifiers, and should use english words wherever feasible (in many\\ncases, abbreviations and technical terms are used which aren’t\\nenglish). \\n open source projects with a global audience are encouraged to adopt a\\nsimilar policy. \\n \\n \\n imports \\n \\n imports should usually be on separate lines: # correct: \\n import   os \\n import   sys \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n import   sys ,   os \\n \\n \\n it’s okay to say this though: \\n # correct: \\n from   subprocess   import   popen ,   pipe \\n \\n \\n \\n imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module\\ncomments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants. imports should be grouped in the following order: \\n \\n standard library imports. \\n related third party imports. \\n local application/library specific imports. \\n \\n you should put a blank line between each group of imports. \\n \\n absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable\\nand tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error\\nmessages) if the import system is incorrectly configured (such as\\nwhen a directory inside a package ends up on  sys.path ): import   mypkg.sibling \\n from   mypkg   import   sibling \\n from   mypkg.sibling   import   example \\n \\n \\n however, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to\\nabsolute imports, especially when dealing with complex package layouts\\nwhere using absolute imports would be unnecessarily verbose: \\n from   .   import   sibling \\n from   .sibling   import   example \\n \\n \\n standard library code should avoid complex package layouts and always\\nuse absolute imports. \\n \\n when importing a class from a class-containing module, it’s usually\\nokay to spell this: from   myclass   import   myclass \\n from   foo.bar.yourclass   import   yourclass \\n \\n \\n if this spelling causes local name clashes, then spell them explicitly: \\n import   myclass \\n import   foo.bar.yourclass \\n \\n \\n and use “myclass.myclass” and “foo.bar.yourclass.yourclass”. \\n \\n wildcard imports ( from   <module>   import   * ) should be avoided, as\\nthey make it unclear which names are present in the namespace,\\nconfusing both readers and many automated tools. there is one\\ndefensible use case for a wildcard import, which is to republish an\\ninternal interface as part of a public api (for example, overwriting\\na pure python implementation of an interface with the definitions\\nfrom an optional accelerator module and exactly which definitions\\nwill be overwritten isn’t known in advance). when republishing names this way, the guidelines below regarding\\npublic and internal interfaces still apply. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n module level dunder names \\n module level “dunders” (i.e. names with two leading and two trailing\\nunderscores) such as  __all__ ,  __author__ ,  __version__ ,\\netc. should be placed after the module docstring but before any import\\nstatements  except   from   __future__  imports.  python mandates that\\nfuture-imports must appear in the module before any other code except\\ndocstrings: \\n \"\"\"this is the example module. \\n\\n this module does stuff. \\n \"\"\" \\n\\n from   __future__   import   barry_as_flufl \\n\\n __all__   =   [ \\'a\\' ,   \\'b\\' ,   \\'c\\' ] \\n __version__   =   \\'0.1\\' \\n __author__   =   \\'cardinal biggles\\' \\n\\n import   os \\n import   sys \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n string quotes \\n in python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the\\nsame.  this pep does not make a recommendation for this.  pick a rule\\nand stick to it.  when a string contains single or double quote\\ncharacters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the\\nstring. it improves readability. \\n for triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be\\nconsistent with the docstring convention in  pep 257 . \\n \\n \\n whitespace in expressions and statements \\n \\n pet peeves \\n avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations: \\n \\n immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces: # correct: \\n spam ( ham [ 1 ],   { eggs :   2 }) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n spam (   ham [   1   ],   {   eggs :   2   }   ) \\n \\n \\n \\n between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis: # correct: \\n foo   =   ( 0 ,) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n bar   =   ( 0 ,   ) \\n \\n \\n \\n immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon: # correct: \\n if   x   ==   4 :   print ( x ,   y );   x ,   y   =   y ,   x \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   x   ==   4   :   print ( x   ,   y )   ;   x   ,   y   =   y   ,   x \\n \\n \\n \\n however, in a slice the colon acts like a binary operator, and\\nshould have equal amounts on either side (treating it as the\\noperator with the lowest priority).  in an extended slice, both\\ncolons must have the same amount of spacing applied.  exception:\\nwhen a slice parameter is omitted, the space is omitted: # correct: \\n ham [ 1 : 9 ],   ham [ 1 : 9 : 3 ],   ham [: 9 : 3 ],   ham [ 1 :: 3 ],   ham [ 1 : 9 :] \\n ham [ lower : upper ],   ham [ lower : upper :],   ham [ lower :: step ] \\n ham [ lower + offset   :   upper + offset ] \\n ham [:   upper_fn ( x )   :   step_fn ( x )],   ham [::   step_fn ( x )] \\n ham [ lower   +   offset   :   upper   +   offset ] \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n ham [ lower   +   offset : upper   +   offset ] \\n ham [ 1 :   9 ],   ham [ 1   : 9 ],   ham [ 1 : 9   : 3 ] \\n ham [ lower   :   :   upper ] \\n ham [   :   upper ] \\n \\n \\n \\n immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument\\nlist of a function call: # correct: \\n spam ( 1 ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n spam   ( 1 ) \\n \\n \\n \\n immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or\\nslicing: # correct: \\n dct [ \\'key\\' ]   =   lst [ index ] \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n dct   [ \\'key\\' ]   =   lst   [ index ] \\n \\n \\n \\n more than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to\\nalign it with another: # correct: \\n x   =   1 \\n y   =   2 \\n long_variable   =   3 \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n x               =   1 \\n y               =   2 \\n long_variable   =   3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n other recommendations \\n \\n avoid trailing whitespace anywhere.  because it’s usually invisible,\\nit can be confusing: e.g. a backslash followed by a space and a\\nnewline does not count as a line continuation marker.  some editors\\ndon’t preserve it and many projects (like cpython itself) have\\npre-commit hooks that reject it. \\n always surround these binary operators with a single space on either\\nside: assignment ( = ), augmented assignment ( += ,  -= \\netc.), comparisons ( == ,  < ,  > ,  != ,  <> ,  <= ,\\n >= ,  in ,  not   in ,  is ,  is   not ), booleans ( and ,\\n or ,  not ). \\n if operators with different priorities are used, consider adding\\nwhitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). use\\nyour own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and\\nalways have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary\\noperator: # correct: \\n i   =   i   +   1 \\n submitted   +=   1 \\n x   =   x * 2   -   1 \\n hypot2   =   x * x   +   y * y \\n c   =   ( a + b )   *   ( a - b ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n i = i + 1 \\n submitted   += 1 \\n x   =   x   *   2   -   1 \\n hypot2   =   x   *   x   +   y   *   y \\n c   =   ( a   +   b )   *   ( a   -   b ) \\n \\n \\n \\n function annotations should use the normal rules for colons and\\nalways have spaces around the  ->  arrow if present.

\\n comments should be complete sentences.  the first word should be\\ncapitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case\\nletter (never alter the case of identifiers!). \\n block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of\\ncomplete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period. \\n you should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period in multi-\\nsentence comments, except after the final sentence. \\n ensure that your comments are clear and easily understandable to other\\nspeakers of the language you are writing in. \\n python coders from non-english speaking countries: please write your\\ncomments in english, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never\\nbe read by people who don’t speak your language. \\n \\n block comments \\n block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows\\nthem, and are indented to the same level as that code.  each line of a\\nblock comment starts with a  #  and a single space (unless it is\\nindented text inside the comment). \\n paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a\\nsingle  # . \\n \\n \\n inline comments \\n use inline comments sparingly. \\n an inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.\\ninline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the\\nstatement.  they should start with a # and a single space. \\n inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state\\nthe obvious.  don’t do this: \\n x   =   x   +   1                   # increment x \\n \\n \\n but sometimes, this is useful: \\n x   =   x   +   1                   # compensate for border \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n documentation strings \\n conventions for writing good documentation strings\\n(a.k.a. “docstrings”) are immortalized in  pep 257 . \\n \\n write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and\\nmethods.  docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but\\nyou should have a comment that describes what the method does.  this\\ncomment should appear after the  def  line. \\n pep 257  describes good docstring conventions.  note that most\\nimportantly, the  \"\"\"  that ends a multiline docstring should be\\non a line by itself: \"\"\"return a foobang \\n\\n optional plotz says to frobnicate the bizbaz first. \\n \"\"\" \\n \\n \\n \\n for one liner docstrings, please keep the closing  \"\"\"  on\\nthe same line: \"\"\"return an ex-parrot.\"\"\" \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n naming conventions \\n the naming conventions of python’s library are a bit of a mess, so\\nwe’ll never get this completely consistent – nevertheless, here are\\nthe currently recommended naming standards.  new modules and packages\\n(including third party frameworks) should be written to these\\nstandards, but where an existing library has a different style,\\ninternal consistency is preferred. \\n \\n overriding principle \\n names that are visible to the user as public parts of the api should\\nfollow conventions that reflect usage rather than implementation. \\n \\n \\n descriptive: naming styles \\n there are a lot of different naming styles.  it helps to be able to\\nrecognize what naming style is being used, independently from what\\nthey are used for. \\n the following naming styles are commonly distinguished: \\n \\n b  (single lowercase letter) \\n b  (single uppercase letter) \\n lowercase \\n lower_case_with_underscores \\n uppercase \\n upper_case_with_underscores \\n capitalizedwords  (or capwords, or camelcase – so named because\\nof the bumpy look of its letters  [4] ).  this is also sometimes known\\nas studlycaps. note: when using acronyms in capwords, capitalize all the\\nletters of the acronym.  thus httpservererror is better than\\nhttpservererror. \\n \\n mixedcase  (differs from capitalizedwords by initial lowercase\\ncharacter!) \\n capitalized_words_with_underscores  (ugly!) \\n \\n there’s also the style of using a short unique prefix to group related\\nnames together.  this is not used much in python, but it is mentioned\\nfor completeness.  for example, the  os.stat()  function returns a\\ntuple whose items traditionally have names like  st_mode ,\\n st_size ,  st_mtime  and so on.  (this is done to emphasize the\\ncorrespondence with the fields of the posix system call struct, which\\nhelps programmers familiar with that.) \\n the x11 library uses a leading x for all its public functions.  in\\npython, this style is generally deemed unnecessary because attribute\\nand method names are prefixed with an object, and function names are\\nprefixed with a module name. \\n in addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing\\nunderscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any\\ncase convention): \\n \\n _single_leading_underscore : weak “internal use” indicator.\\ne.g.  from   m   import   *  does not import objects whose names start\\nwith an underscore. \\n single_trailing_underscore_ : used by convention to avoid\\nconflicts with python keyword, e.g. tkinter . toplevel ( master ,   class_ = \\'classname\\' ) \\n \\n \\n \\n __double_leading_underscore : when naming a class attribute,\\ninvokes name mangling (inside class foobar,  __boo  becomes\\n _foobar__boo ; see below). \\n __double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__ : “magic” objects or\\nattributes that live in user-controlled namespaces.\\ne.g.  __init__ ,  __import__  or  __file__ .  never invent\\nsuch names; only use them as documented. \\n \\n \\n \\n prescriptive: naming conventions \\n \\n names to avoid \\n never use the characters ‘l’ (lowercase letter el), ‘o’ (uppercase\\nletter oh), or ‘i’ (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable\\nnames. \\n in some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the\\nnumerals one and zero.  when tempted to use ‘l’, use ‘l’ instead. \\n \\n \\n ascii compatibility \\n identifiers used in the standard library must be ascii compatible\\nas described in the\\n policy section \\nof  pep 3131 . \\n \\n \\n package and module names \\n modules should have short, all-lowercase names.  underscores can be\\nused in the module name if it improves readability.  python packages\\nshould also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of\\nunderscores is discouraged. \\n when an extension module written in c or c++ has an accompanying\\npython module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented)\\ninterface, the c/c++ module has a leading underscore\\n(e.g.  _socket ). \\n \\n \\n class names \\n class names should normally use the capwords convention. \\n the naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where\\nthe interface is documented and used primarily as a callable. \\n note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin\\nnames are single words (or two words run together), with the capwords\\nconvention used only for exception names and builtin constants. \\n \\n \\n type variable names \\n names of type variables introduced in  pep 484  should normally use capwords\\npreferring short names:  t ,  anystr ,  num . it is recommended to add\\nsuffixes  _co  or  _contra  to the variables used to declare covariant\\nor contravariant behavior correspondingly: \\n from   typing   import   typevar \\n\\n vt_co   =   typevar ( \\'vt_co\\' ,   covariant = true ) \\n kt_contra   =   typevar ( \\'kt_contra\\' ,   contravariant = true ) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n exception names \\n because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention\\napplies here.  however, you should use the suffix “error” on your\\nexception names (if the exception actually is an error). \\n \\n \\n global variable names \\n (let’s hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module\\nonly.)  the conventions are about the same as those for functions. \\n modules that are designed for use via  from   m   import   *  should use\\nthe  __all__  mechanism to prevent exporting globals, or use the\\nolder convention of prefixing such globals with an underscore (which\\nyou might want to do to indicate these globals are “module\\nnon-public”). \\n \\n \\n function and variable names \\n function names should be lowercase, with words separated by\\nunderscores as necessary to improve readability. \\n variable names follow the same convention as function names. \\n mixedcase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the\\nprevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards\\ncompatibility. \\n \\n \\n function and method arguments \\n always use  self  for the first argument to instance methods. \\n always use  cls  for the first argument to class methods. \\n if a function argument’s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is\\ngenerally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than\\nuse an abbreviation or spelling corruption.  thus  class_  is better\\nthan  clss .  (perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a\\nsynonym.) \\n \\n \\n method names and instance variables \\n use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by\\nunderscores as necessary to improve readability. \\n use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance\\nvariables. \\n to avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to\\ninvoke python’s name mangling rules. \\n python mangles these names with the class name: if class foo has an\\nattribute named  __a , it cannot be accessed by  foo.__a .  (an\\ninsistent user could still gain access by calling  foo._foo__a .)\\ngenerally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid\\nname conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed. \\n note: there is some controversy about the use of __names (see below). \\n \\n \\n constants \\n constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all\\ncapital letters with underscores separating words.  examples include\\n max_overflow  and  total . \\n \\n \\n designing for inheritance \\n always decide whether a class’s methods and instance variables\\n(collectively: “attributes”) should be public or non-public.  if in\\ndoubt, choose non-public; it’s easier to make it public later than to\\nmake a public attribute non-public. \\n public attributes are those that you expect unrelated clients of your\\nclass to use, with your commitment to avoid backwards incompatible\\nchanges.  non-public attributes are those that are not intended to be\\nused by third parties; you make no guarantees that non-public\\nattributes won’t change or even be removed. \\n we don’t use the term “private” here, since no attribute is really\\nprivate in python (without a generally unnecessary amount of work). \\n another category of attributes are those that are part of the\\n“subclass api” (often called “protected” in other languages).  some\\nclasses are designed to be inherited from, either to extend or modify\\naspects of the class’s behavior.  when designing such a class, take\\ncare to make explicit decisions about which attributes are public,\\nwhich are part of the subclass api, and which are truly only to be\\nused by your base class. \\n with this in mind, here are the pythonic guidelines: \\n \\n public attributes should have no leading underscores. \\n if your public attribute name collides with a reserved keyword,\\nappend a single trailing underscore to your attribute name.  this is\\npreferable to an abbreviation or corrupted spelling.  (however,\\nnotwithstanding this rule, ‘cls’ is the preferred spelling for any\\nvariable or argument which is known to be a class, especially the\\nfirst argument to a class method.) note 1: see the argument name recommendation above for class methods. \\n \\n for simple public data attributes, it is best to expose just the\\nattribute name, without complicated accessor/mutator methods.  keep\\nin mind that python provides an easy path to future enhancement,\\nshould you find that a simple data attribute needs to grow\\nfunctional behavior.  in that case, use properties to hide\\nfunctional implementation behind simple data attribute access\\nsyntax. note 1: try to keep the functional behavior side-effect free,\\nalthough side-effects such as caching are generally fine. \\n note 2: avoid using properties for computationally expensive\\noperations; the attribute notation makes the caller believe that\\naccess is (relatively) cheap. \\n \\n if your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes\\nthat you do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with\\ndouble leading underscores and no trailing underscores.  this\\ninvokes python’s name mangling algorithm, where the name of the\\nclass is mangled into the attribute name.  this helps avoid\\nattribute name collisions should subclasses inadvertently contain\\nattributes with the same name. note 1: note that only the simple class name is used in the mangled\\nname, so if a subclass chooses both the same class name and attribute\\nname, you can still get name collisions. \\n note 2: name mangling can make certain uses, such as debugging and\\n __getattr__() , less convenient.  however the name mangling\\nalgorithm is well documented and easy to perform manually. \\n note 3: not everyone likes name mangling.  try to balance the\\nneed to avoid accidental name clashes with potential use by\\nadvanced callers. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n public and internal interfaces \\n any backwards compatibility guarantees apply only to public interfaces.\\naccordingly, it is important that users be able to clearly distinguish\\nbetween public and internal interfaces. \\n documented interfaces are considered public, unless the documentation\\nexplicitly declares them to be provisional or internal interfaces exempt\\nfrom the usual backwards compatibility guarantees. all undocumented\\ninterfaces should be assumed to be internal. \\n to better support introspection, modules should explicitly declare the\\nnames in their public api using the  __all__  attribute. setting\\n __all__  to an empty list indicates that the module has no public api. \\n even with  __all__  set appropriately, internal interfaces (packages,\\nmodules, classes, functions, attributes or other names) should still be\\nprefixed with a single leading underscore. \\n an interface is also considered internal if any containing namespace\\n(package, module or class) is considered internal. \\n imported names should always be considered an implementation detail.\\nother modules must not rely on indirect access to such imported names\\nunless they are an explicitly documented part of the containing module’s\\napi, such as  os.path  or a package’s  __init__  module that exposes\\nfunctionality from submodules. \\n \\n \\n \\n programming recommendations \\n \\n code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other\\nimplementations of python (pypy, jython, ironpython, cython, psyco,\\nand such). for example, do not rely on cpython’s efficient implementation of\\nin-place string concatenation for statements in the form  a   +=   b \\nor  a   =   a   +   b .  this optimization is fragile even in cpython (it\\nonly works for some types) and isn’t present at all in implementations\\nthat don’t use refcounting.  in performance sensitive parts of the\\nlibrary, the  \\'\\'.join()  form should be used instead.  this will\\nensure that concatenation occurs in linear time across various\\nimplementations. \\n \\n comparisons to singletons like none should always be done with\\n is  or  is   not , never the equality operators. also, beware of writing  if   x  when you really mean  if   x   is   not \\n none  – e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that\\ndefaults to none was set to some other value.  the other value might\\nhave a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean\\ncontext! \\n \\n use  is   not  operator rather than  not   ...   is .  while both\\nexpressions are functionally identical, the former is more readable\\nand preferred: # correct: \\n if   foo   is   not   none : \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   not   foo   is   none : \\n \\n \\n \\n when implementing ordering operations with rich comparisons, it is\\nbest to implement all six operations ( __eq__ ,  __ne__ ,\\n __lt__ ,  __le__ ,  __gt__ ,  __ge__ ) rather than relying\\non other code to only exercise a particular comparison. to minimize the effort involved, the  functools.total_ordering() \\ndecorator provides a tool to generate missing comparison methods. \\n pep 207  indicates that reflexivity rules  are  assumed by python.\\nthus, the interpreter may swap  y   >   x  with  x   <   y ,  y   >=   x \\nwith  x   <=   y , and may swap the arguments of  x   ==   y  and  x   != \\n y .  the  sort()  and  min()  operations are guaranteed to use\\nthe  <  operator and the  max()  function uses the  > \\noperator.  however, it is best to implement all six operations so\\nthat confusion doesn’t arise in other contexts. \\n \\n always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds\\na lambda expression directly to an identifier: # correct: \\n def   f ( x ):   return   2 * x \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n f   =   lambda   x :   2 * x \\n \\n \\n the first form means that the name of the resulting function object is\\nspecifically ‘f’ instead of the generic ‘<lambda>’. this is more\\nuseful for tracebacks and string representations in general. the use\\nof the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda\\nexpression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can\\nbe embedded inside a larger expression) \\n \\n derive exceptions from  exception  rather than  baseexception .\\ndirect inheritance from  baseexception  is reserved for exceptions\\nwhere catching them is almost always the wrong thing to do. design exception hierarchies based on the distinctions that code\\n catching  the exceptions is likely to need, rather than the locations\\nwhere the exceptions are raised. aim to answer the question\\n“what went wrong?” programmatically, rather than only stating that\\n“a problem occurred” (see  pep 3151  for an example of this lesson being\\nlearned for the builtin exception hierarchy) \\n class naming conventions apply here, although you should add the\\nsuffix “error” to your exception classes if the exception is an\\nerror.  non-error exceptions that are used for non-local flow control\\nor other forms of signaling need no special suffix. \\n \\n use exception chaining appropriately.  raise   x   from   y \\nshould be used to indicate explicit replacement without losing the\\noriginal traceback. when deliberately replacing an inner exception (using  raise   x   from \\n none ), ensure that relevant details are transferred to the new\\nexception (such as preserving the attribute name when converting\\nkeyerror to attributeerror, or embedding the text of the original\\nexception in the new exception message). \\n \\n when catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever\\npossible instead of using a bare  except:  clause: try : \\n     import   platform_specific_module \\n except   importerror : \\n     platform_specific_module   =   none \\n \\n \\n a bare  except:  clause will catch systemexit and\\nkeyboardinterrupt exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a\\nprogram with control-c, and can disguise other problems.  if you\\nwant to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use\\n except   exception:  (bare except is equivalent to  except \\n baseexception: ). \\n a good rule of thumb is to limit use of bare ‘except’ clauses to two\\ncases: \\n \\n if the exception handler will be printing out or logging the\\ntraceback; at least the user will be aware that an error has\\noccurred. \\n if the code needs to do some cleanup work, but then lets the\\nexception propagate upwards with  raise .   try...finally \\ncan be a better way to handle this case. \\n \\n \\n when catching operating system errors, prefer the explicit exception\\nhierarchy introduced in python 3.3 over introspection of  errno \\nvalues. \\n additionally, for all try/except clauses, limit the  try  clause\\nto the absolute minimum amount of code necessary.  again, this\\navoids masking bugs: # correct: \\n try : \\n     value   =   collection [ key ] \\n except   keyerror : \\n     return   key_not_found ( key ) \\n else : \\n     return   handle_value ( value ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n try : \\n     # too broad! \\n     return   handle_value ( collection [ key ]) \\n except   keyerror : \\n     # will also catch keyerror raised by handle_value() \\n     return   key_not_found ( key ) \\n \\n \\n \\n when a resource is local to a particular section of code, use a\\n with  statement to ensure it is cleaned up promptly and reliably\\nafter use. a try/finally statement is also acceptable. \\n context managers should be invoked through separate functions or methods\\nwhenever they do something other than acquire and release resources: # correct: \\n with   conn . begin_transaction (): \\n     do_stuff_in_transaction ( conn ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n with   conn : \\n     do_stuff_in_transaction ( conn ) \\n \\n \\n the latter example doesn’t provide any information to indicate that\\nthe  __enter__  and  __exit__  methods are doing something other\\nthan closing the connection after a transaction.  being explicit is\\nimportant in this case. \\n \\n be consistent in return statements.  either all return statements in\\na function should return an expression, or none of them should.  if\\nany return statement returns an expression, any return statements\\nwhere no value is returned should explicitly state this as  return \\n none , and an explicit return statement should be present at the\\nend of the function (if reachable): # correct: \\n\\n def   foo ( x ): \\n     if   x   >=   0 : \\n         return   math . sqrt ( x ) \\n     else : \\n         return   none \\n\\n def   bar ( x ): \\n     if   x   <   0 : \\n         return   none \\n     return   math . sqrt ( x ) \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n\\n def   foo ( x ): \\n     if   x   >=   0 : \\n         return   math . sqrt ( x ) \\n\\n def   bar ( x ): \\n     if   x   <   0 : \\n         return \\n     return   math . sqrt ( x ) \\n \\n \\n \\n use  \\'\\'.startswith()  and  \\'\\'.endswith()  instead of string\\nslicing to check for prefixes or suffixes. startswith() and endswith() are cleaner and less error prone: \\n # correct: \\n if   foo . startswith ( \\'bar\\' ): \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   foo [: 3 ]   ==   \\'bar\\' : \\n \\n \\n \\n object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead of\\ncomparing types directly: # correct: \\n if   isinstance ( obj ,   int ): \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   type ( obj )   is   type ( 1 ): \\n \\n \\n \\n for sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty\\nsequences are false: # correct: \\n if   not   seq : \\n if   seq : \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   len ( seq ): \\n if   not   len ( seq ): \\n \\n \\n \\n don’t write string literals that rely on significant trailing\\nwhitespace.  such trailing whitespace is visually indistinguishable\\nand some editors (or more recently, reindent.py) will trim them. \\n don’t compare boolean values to true or false using  == : # correct: \\n if   greeting : \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n if   greeting   ==   true : \\n \\n \\n worse: \\n # wrong: \\n if   greeting   is   true : \\n \\n \\n \\n use of the flow control statements  return / break / continue \\nwithin the finally suite of a  try...finally , where the flow control\\nstatement would jump outside the finally suite, is discouraged.  this\\nis because such statements will implicitly cancel any active exception\\nthat is propagating through the finally suite: # wrong: \\n def   foo (): \\n     try : \\n         1   /   0 \\n     finally : \\n         return   42 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n function annotations \\n with the acceptance of  pep 484 , the style rules for function\\nannotations have changed. \\n \\n function annotations should use  pep 484  syntax (there are some\\nformatting recommendations for annotations in the previous section). \\n the experimentation with annotation styles that was recommended\\npreviously in this pep is no longer encouraged. \\n however, outside the stdlib, experiments within the rules of  pep 484 \\nare now encouraged.  for example, marking up a large third party\\nlibrary or application with  pep 484  style type annotations,\\nreviewing how easy it was to add those annotations, and observing\\nwhether their presence increases code understandability. \\n the python standard library should be conservative in adopting such\\nannotations, but their use is allowed for new code and for big\\nrefactorings. \\n for code that wants to make a different use of function annotations\\nit is recommended to put a comment of the form: # type: ignore \\n \\n \\n near the top of the file; this tells type checkers to ignore all\\nannotations.  (more fine-grained ways of disabling complaints from\\ntype checkers can be found in  pep 484 .) \\n \\n like linters, type checkers are optional, separate tools.  python\\ninterpreters by default should not issue any messages due to type\\nchecking and should not alter their behavior based on annotations. \\n users who don’t want to use type checkers are free to ignore them.\\nhowever, it is expected that users of third party library packages\\nmay want to run type checkers over those packages.  for this purpose\\n pep 484  recommends the use of stub files: .pyi files that are read\\nby the type checker in preference of the corresponding .py files.\\nstub files can be distributed with a library, or separately (with\\nthe library author’s permission) through the typeshed repo  [5] . \\n \\n \\n \\n variable annotations \\n pep 526  introduced variable annotations. the style recommendations for them are\\nsimilar to those on function annotations described above: \\n \\n annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables,\\nand local variables should have a single space after the colon. \\n there should be no space before the colon. \\n if an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have\\nexactly one space on both sides: # correct: \\n\\n code :   int \\n\\n class   point : \\n     coords :   tuple [ int ,   int ] \\n     label :   str   =   \\'<unknown>\\' \\n \\n \\n # wrong: \\n\\n code : int    # no space after colon \\n code   :   int    # space before colon \\n\\n class   test : \\n     result :   int = 0    # no spaces around equality sign \\n \\n \\n \\n although the  pep 526  is accepted for python 3.6, the variable annotation\\nsyntax is the preferred syntax for stub files on all versions of python\\n(see  pep 484  for details). \\n \\n footnotes \\n \\n \\n [ 1 ] \\n hanging indentation  is a type-setting style where all\\nthe lines in a paragraph are indented except the first line.  in\\nthe context of python, the term is used to describe a style where\\nthe opening parenthesis of a parenthesized statement is the last\\nnon-whitespace character of the line, with subsequent lines being\\nindented until the closing parenthesis. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n references \\n \\n \\n [ 2 ] \\n barry’s gnu mailman style guide\\n http://barry.warsaw.us/software/styleguide.txt \\n \\n [ 3 ] \\n donald knuth’s  the texbook , pages 195 and 196. \\n \\n [ 4 ] \\n http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/camelcase \\n \\n [ 5 ] \\n typeshed repo\\n https://github.com/python/typeshed \\n \\n \\n \\n copyright \\n this document has been placed in the public domain. \\n \\n \\n \\n source:  https://github.com/python/peps/blob/main/pep-0008.txt \\n last modified:  2022-05-11 17:45:05 gmt \\n \\n \\n contents \\n \\n introduction \\n a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds \\n code lay-out \\n indentation \\n tabs or spaces? \\n maximum line length \\n should a line break before or after a binary operator? \\n blank lines \\n source file encoding \\n imports \\n module level dunder names \\n \\n \\n string quotes \\n whitespace in expressions and statements \\n pet peeves \\n other recommendations \\n \\n \\n when to use trailing commas \\n comments \\n block comments \\n inline comments \\n documentation strings \\n \\n \\n naming conventions \\n overriding principle \\n descriptive: naming styles \\n prescriptive: naming conventions \\n names to avoid \\n ascii compatibility \\n package and module names \\n class names \\n type variable names \\n exception names \\n global variable names \\n function and variable names \\n function and method arguments \\n method names and instance variables \\n constants \\n designing for inheritance \\n \\n \\n public and internal interfaces \\n \\n \\n programming recommendations \\n function annotations \\n variable annotations \\n \\n \\n references \\n copyright \\n \\n \\n page source (github) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",
